This directory contains IPsec CLI configuration examples that can
be used e.g. with the fpm or fpm_burstmode example applications.

The examples create an IPsec tunnel between two VRF instances that
are connected externally through two fast path ports. See the .cli
files for details.

The use of VRFs require num_vrf be set in OFP configuration. ofp.conf
is an example configuration file for the fpm example application.

Note that OFP must be built with --disable-sp configuration flag
to enable IPsec.
